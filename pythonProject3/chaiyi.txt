In the morning, after breakfast, I took a bottle of pure milk. But I didnt want to drink a few drinks because it was so hot that I wanted ice cream. But mom wouldnt let me eat ice cream in the morning. Suddenly, I had an idea in my head: what would it look like if I put the milk in the fridge to freeze? So I put the milk in the fridge drawer, gently closed the refrigerator door, and waited.
After a long time, I gently opened the door of the refrigerator and took out the ice cream this morning. Wow, what ice! I want to stick the straw in, but it doesnt move. Did milk really become ice cream? Lets take a look first.
So, I took a pair of scissors, cut the box of milk to a bar, appeared in front of the white, hard and hard ice, the original milk has turned into ice cream.
I ran to the kitchen to get a fork, and to mash up the milk ice cream bit by bit, it looked like the snow in the snow in winter. Then, I tasted a small mouth, good ice, cool! But it doesnt taste very good. Because pure milk itself has no taste. If the ice is other milk, I think it will taste better.
